Build instructions:

make or make all will make all necessary object files as well as knn.exe, NaiveBayes.exe, and ID3.exe

make knn, make nb, and make id3 will only make the object files and the specified executable

make depend will make the dependency file (although this is not a necessary command to run)

make clean will remove all executables, object files, and the Makefile.dep
